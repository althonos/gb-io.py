## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

`gb-io.py` is a Python package that provides an interface to `gb-io`, a very
fast GenBank format parser implemented in Rust. It can reach much higher
speed than the [Biopython](http://biopython.org/) or
the [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/) parsers.

This library has no external dependency and is available for all modern Python
versions (3.7+).

## üîß Installing

Install the `gb-io` package directly from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/gb-io)
which hosts pre-compiled wheels that can be installed with `pip`:
```console
$ pip install gb-io
```

Wheels are provided for the following platforms:
- Linux, CPython, x86-64
- Linux, CPython, Aarch64
- MacOS, CPython, x86-64
- MacOS, PyPy, x86-64

Otherwise, the source distribution will be downloaded, and a local copy of
the Rust compiler will be downloaded to build the package, unless it is
already installed on the host machine.

<!-- ## üìñ Documentation

A complete [API reference](https://gb-io.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html)
can be found in the [online documentation](https://gb-io.readthedocs.io/),
or directly from the command line using
[`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html):
```console
$ pydoc gb_io
``` -->

## üí° Usage

Use the `gb_io.load` function to obtain a list of all GenBank records in a file:
```python
records = gb_io.load("tests/data/AY048670.1.gb")
```

Reading from a file-like object is supported as well, both in text and
binary mode:
```python
with open("tests/data/AY048670.1.gb") as file:
    records = gb_io.load(file)
```

It is also possible to iterate over each record in the file without having
to load the entirety of the file contents to memory with the `gb_io.iter`
method, which returns an iterator instead of a list:
```python
for record in gb_io.iter("tests/data/AY048670.1.gb"):
    print(record.name, record.sequence[:10])
```

## üìù Example

The following small script will extract all the CDS features from a GenBank
file, and write them in FASTA format to an output file:
```python
import gb_io

with open("tests/data/AY048670.1.faa", "w") as dst:
    for record in gb_io.iter("tests/data/AY048670.1.gb"):
        for feature in filter(lambda feat: feat.type == "CDS", record.features):
            qualifiers = feature.qualifiers.to_dict()
            dst.write(">{}\n".format(qualifiers["locus_tag"][0]))
            dst.write("{}\n".format(qualifiers["translation"][0]))
```

Compared to similar implementations using `Bio.SeqIO.parse`, `Bio.GenBank.parse`
and `Bio.GenBank.Scanner.GenBankScanner.parse_cds_features`, the performance is
the following:

|               | `gb_io.iter`  | `GenBankScanner` | `GenBank.parse` | `SeqIO.parse` |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Time (s)      | **2.264**     | 7.982            | 15.259          | 19.351        |
| Speed (MiB/s) | **136.5**     | 37.1             | 20.5            | 16.2          |
| Speedup       | **x8.55**     | x2.42            | x1.27           | -             |
